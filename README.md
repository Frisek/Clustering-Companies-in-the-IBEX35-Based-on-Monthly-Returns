# Clustering-Companies-in-the-IBEX35-Based-on-Monthly-Returns
## Clustering

This project demonstrates how to perform clustering on the companies of the IBEX35 based on their monthly returns, using the K-Means algorithm. The K-Means algorithm is a popular unsupervised learning technique that aims to partition a set of data points into a predetermined number of clusters. In this example, the data consists of monthly returns of the companies in the IBEX35, and the goal is to group the companies based on their similarity in terms of returns.

After applying K-Means clustering to the data, the resulting clusters are labeled with integers starting from 0. The output of the clustering process for each company is a single integer that indicates the cluster to which the company belongs. For example, an output of array([0], dtype=int32) means that the company is assigned to cluster 0.

By analyzing the clustering results, we can gain insights into the behavior of the companies in the IBEX35 and identify groups of companies with similar returns.
